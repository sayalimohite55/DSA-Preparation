/*
* Question:
* You are given an array of positive integers price where price[i] denotes the price of the ith candy
* and a positive integer k.
* The store sells baskets of k distinct candies.
* The tastiness of a candy basket is the smallest absolute difference of the prices of any two candies in the basket.
* Return the maximum tastiness of a candy basket.
*
*
* eg.
* Input: price = [13,5,1,8,21,2], k = 3
* Output: 8
* Explanation: Choose the candies with the prices [13,5,21].
* The tastiness of the candy basket is: min(|13 - 5|, |13 - 21|, |5 - 21|) = min(8, 8, 16) = 8.
* t can be proven that 8 is the maximum tastiness that can be achieved.
