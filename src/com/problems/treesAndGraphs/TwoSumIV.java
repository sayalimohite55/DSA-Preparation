* Question:
* Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements
* in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.
*
* BST: A valid BST is defined as follows:
* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.*/
